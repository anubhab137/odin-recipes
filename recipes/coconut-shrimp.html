                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Step 1: </strong>In medium bowl, combine egg, 
                        1/2 cup flour, beer and baking powder. Place 1/4 cup 
                        flour and coconut in two separate bowls.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Step 2: </strong>Hold shrimp by tail, and 
                        dredge in flour, shaking off excess flour. Dip in 
                        egg/beer batter; allow excess to drip off. Roll 
                        shrimp in coconut, and place on a baking sheet 
                        lined with wax paper. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. 
                        Meanwhile, heat oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) 
                        in a deep-fryer.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Step 3: </strong>Fry shrimp in batches: cook, 
                        turning once, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden 
                        brown. Using tongs, remove shrimp to paper towels to 
                        drain. Serve warm with your favorite dipping sauce.
